Additional Tools:
 
    Application Performance Snapshot
 
       Use Application Performance Snapshot to profile MPI-based applications and get MPI-specific performance insights.
       Type aps --help to see relevant options.
 
    VTune Profiler Server
 
       Use VTune Profiler Server to view collected results in a web browser for a better user experience compared to VNC or X-forwarding.
       Type vtune-backend --data-directory=/path/to/folder/with/collected/results.
 
    Self-checker Script
 
       This script checks if you have installed VTune Profiler correctly and ensures that it is ready for use.
       Type vtune-self-checker.sh to run this script.
 

Examples:
 
 1) Start with a performance snapshot. Get a quick overview of potential performance issues. Identify next steps for a deeper analysis:
 
    vtune -collect performance-snapshot a.out
 
 2) Run a hotspots collection (in user-mode sampling) on the specified target:
 
    vtune -collect hotspots a.out
 
 3) Run a hotspot collection (hardware event-based sampling) with non-default sampling interval 0.5 ms:
 
    vtune -collect hotspots -knob sampling-mode=hw -knob sampling-interval=0.5 a.out
 
 4) Generate the hotspots report for the 'r000hs' result directory:
 
    vtune -report hotspots -r r000hs
 
 5) Run microarchitecture exploration analysis as ‘vtune_user’ on a remote target with IP address 192.0.2.0:
 
    vtune -target-system ssh:vtune_user@192.0.2.0 -collect uarch-exploration a.out
 
 6) Profile system with memory access analysis for 20 seconds:
 
    vtune -collect memory-access -d 20
 
 7) Run gpu-hotspots collection on the process labeled PID 1234:
 
    vtune -collect gpu-hotspots -target-pid 1234
 
 8) Run HPC performance characterization analysis on MPI application 'a.out' executed with Intel MPI Launcher:
 
    mpirun -n 48 -ppn 24 vtune -collect hpc-performance -data-limit=0 -r my_result_dir a.out
 
 9) Show options for collect command:
 
    vtune -help collect
 
 10) Show options for threading analysis:
 
    vtune -help collect threading
